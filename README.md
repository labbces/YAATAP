# Yet Another Auto Transcript Assembly Pipeline
[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflow-snakemake-blue)](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) [![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success.svg)]() [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)  

YAATAP is a fully automated pipeline for _de novo_ transcriptome assembly, implemented using Snakemake. It performs every step from raw RNA-seq data download to the final transcriptome assembly and quality assessment.

# installing and configuring environments

```bash
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/labbces/YAATAP.git
cd YAATAP

# add bioconda and conda-forge channels before creating the environment
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# create YAATAP environment
conda env create -n YAATAP -f env/environment.yml
```

---

# configuring pipeline

To run YAATAP, the following files must be configured:

- **[config.yaml](https://github.com/labbces/YAATAP/blob/main/config.yaml)**: contains paths to external tools.  
- **[genotype_samples.csv](https://github.com/labbces/YAATAP/blob/main/SP80-3280_samples.csv)**: CSV file listing SRA accessions to be downloaded (e.g. `SRR1974519`,`SRR1979656`,`SRR1979657`,...).  
>[!IMPORTANT]
>The filename must include the genotype name, e.g., `SP80-3280_samples.csv`.  
- **[parts.csv](https://github.com/labbces/YAATAP/blob/main/parts.csv)**: defines the number of parts for Kraken2 database splitting (e.g., `00`,`01`,`02`,`03`,`04`).

# usage

```bash
# activate the environment
conda activate YAATAP

# dry-run (test)
snakemake -np

# run on HPC (example with SGE)
qsub Snakefile.sh
```

# common issues

<details>
  <summary>There is not enough space on the disk</summary>
  
  By default, SRA Toolkit caches downloaded reads in your home directory. On HPC systems, configure a custom cache location: [Quick Toolkit Configuration](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/03.-Quick-Toolkit-Configuration)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>No module named 'busco'</summary>
  
  Snakemake might encounter issues when executing BUSCO, leading to the following error
  
  ```
  No module named 'busco'
  There was a problem installing BUSCO or importing one of its dependencies. See the user guide and the GitLab issue board (https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/issues) if you need further assistance.
  ```
  
  To fix it, simply update the shebang in BUSCO to specify your python environment (the path to python in Conda):

  ```bash
  conda activate YAATAP

  # copy the path to python
  which python
  /home/your_username/.conda/envs/YAATAP/bin/python

  # open the executable script of busco  
  which busco
  ~/.conda/envs/YAATAP/bin/busco

  # update the shebang
  vi ~/.conda/envs/YAATAP/bin/busco

  # before
  #!/usr/bin/env python3

  # after
  #!/home/your_username/.conda/envs/YAATAP/bin/python
  ```
